Although renewable energy policies do not have a significantly positive effect on most renewable energy sectors, it does not imply that public policy has been futile. It is exactly the very existence of public policy that provides the foundations for new renewable energies to develop better technologies. Therefore, governments should patiently support other sectors with continuous implementation of policies which will eventually help them build up the capacity to pick up the benefits of government policies.
