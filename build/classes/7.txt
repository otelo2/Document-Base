Renewable energies are considered mostly clean energies, so there is a worldwide initiative to encourage their use. Biomass as a renewable source of energy allows energy generation and despite the lack of maturity in the technologies of certain countries to guarantee the reduction of negative impacts generated during the production and use of this energy, the energy storage capacity for later use contributes favorably to the carbon life cycle and makes it a viable technology for an inclusive mass flow process of electric fluid in non-interconnected areas as well as in areas connected to the main networks [1]. The objective of this article is to present the prospect of biomass consumption by 2050, demonstrating the viability of this energy for countries with high agricultural potential. This includes a summary of biomass production methods and the prospective analysis of atmospheric emissions of this energy
