Global investment in renewable energy has grown sharply in the past five years as countries strive to meet growing energy demands, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and strengthen energy security. Given that a broad group of services are indispensable to the development and functioning of renewable energy projects, the rapid expansion in renewable energy investment and installed capacity worldwide implies a similarly vibrant global market for renewable energy services. This book offers estimates of the U.S. and global markets for trade and investment in services essential to energy production in the solar, wind, small hydropower, and geothermal sectors, as well as discusses trade barriers affecting these services. The book also describes federal programs that provide grants, loans, loan guarantees, and other direct or indirect incentives for energy efficiency, energy conservation, and renewable energy.
